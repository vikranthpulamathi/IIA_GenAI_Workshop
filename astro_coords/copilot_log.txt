# Development Log

This file documents the key steps and decisions made during the development of the Astronomical Coordinate System Converter project.

## Project Setup (2025-05-30)

1. Initial project structure created:
   - Set up main directories (data/, plots/)
   - Created main Python script and documentation files

2. Environment setup:
   - Configured Python environment
   - Installed required packages:
     - astropy for astronomical calculations
     - matplotlib for visualization
     - numpy for numerical operations
     - pandas for data handling

3. Code Development:
   - Implemented coordinate generation function
   - Added coordinate system conversion using astropy.coordinates
   - Created visualization function using matplotlib
   - Added error handling and logging
   - Implemented data saving functionality

4. Documentation:
   - Created comprehensive README.md
   - Added inline code documentation
   - Documented project structure and usage

## Key Design Decisions

1. Used astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord for reliable coordinate transformations
2. Chose Mollweide projection for all-sky visualization
3. Implemented modular code structure for better maintainability
4. Added comprehensive error handling
5. Used pandas for efficient data handling and CSV operations

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:
1. Add command-line arguments for customization
2. Implement additional coordinate systems
3. Add interactive visualization options
4. Include unit tests
5. Add more detailed error reporting
